<h1> MIT-4.032 Class</h1> 
<p>
This class provides an introduction to working with information, data and visualization in a hands-on studio learning environment. Studies the history and theory of information, followed by a series of projects in which students apply the ideas directly. Progresses though basic data analysis, visual design and presentation, and more sophisticated interaction techniques. Topics include storytelling and narrative, choosing representations, understanding audiences, and the role of designers working with data.

<h1>The Clock</h1> 
<p>
Create twelve different visual representations of a clock. This is a creative interpretation of the clock, focused on visual quality, aesthetics and inventiveness. Your interpretation needs to be legible to you (the author), and you need to be able to explain how the time is derived visually at any given point. Think about the different states of the clock. How do they represent the time, how does it look in different moments in time?
